# Getting Started

## Overview

RN Inkpad was developed with the goal of making it easier to create user interfaces that work and look the same regardless of the `platform` it runs on.

## Installation

- Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install rn-inkpad
```

- This library has [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) as unique dependency, however only one font is used, specifically `Ionicons`.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-vector-icons
```

This library has different installation and configuration instructions for each platform, follow its [installation guide](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) to correctly install the library and avoid errors.

Once the library and the dependency are installed, we are ready to use each of the components

## Extra

- Link to [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) in order to view and search for the name of the icon to use.
- If you have problems installing react-native-vector-icons, here is a [template](https://ionic.io/ionicons) with the package already installed and configured on both platforms.
